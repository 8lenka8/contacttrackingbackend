## Contact tracing helps slow down the rate of a pandemic. 

Currently the golden standard involves detailed phone interviews with people who have tested positive. 
Through this, their recent contacts are identified and alerted via phone. 
Extra datasets may be queried and calls made to find people who are not directly known to the patient (e.g. taxi drivers, restaurant staff) 

We propose a solution to use mobile devices to track contacts.

1. Define contact using precise location outdoors and bluetooth indoors (underground)
   With time spent in proximity as an important factor 
   
2. Build a connection graph of all users, with time property (at least 5 minutes next to each other?). 
   Alert recent contacts of confirmed case patients (5 days?).
   
3. Highlight precise locations of likely contamination from affected users 
   (with detail down to particular shops, bus stops and park benches)
